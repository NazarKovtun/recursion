# recursion
## Description
This is a project that implements the use of recursion, recursion tail, for and while tail loops and texts for them.

There are 3 examples used here:
- `factorial` - implementation of calculating the factorial of a number;
- `sum` (`fibonacci`) - implementation of Fibonacci number calculation;
- `space_sum` - implementation of counting the number of spaces in a string.

Each of them has an abstract class and classes thet implement the use of recursion, recursion tail, for and while tail loops.

Each implementation has its own tests written using the Python unittest packege.
